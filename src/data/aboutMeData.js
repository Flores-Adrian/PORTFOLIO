        "I'm Adrian Flores, a Computer Science graduate from California State University, Los Angeles, with a strong interest in software development, data systems, and applied analytics. As a first-generation Mexican American student from an immigrant family, my path into tech has been shaped by curiosity, persistence, and desire to build meaningful, real-world solutions.",
        
        "I enjoy bulding systems that turn complex problems into practical, scalable solutions, whether through code, data analysis, or visualization. I'm especially motivated by work that sits at the intersection of technology, real-world impact, and continuous learning.",

        "Outside the school, I've been involved in technical and community-focused experiences, including servbing as a Project Officer in CSULA's ACM chapter, mentoring peers, and completing the COOP Data Analytics Fellowship while strengthening both my technical foundation and collaborative skills.",

        "I'm currently seeking software engineering or technically focused roles where I can continue growing while contributing to teams that value curiousity, mentorship, and impact.",
